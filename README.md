# Secrets
Secret project is a part of the "Personal Projects" I made during my learning from the Web Developement course at Udemy. You have a secret and do not want except the developer
to see it(do not worry , we respect the privacy). The Secrets web application relies on a login/register system which allows only authenticated users to bypass and access the
secrets. Some of the important learning outcomes of making this project were
1. Getting acquainted with the moongoose databse 
2. ejs templating
3. body-parsing and much much more  because i believe learning is not just limited to a few list of items
